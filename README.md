Home Lab Documentation

### About

This home lab consists of my current home network. The main reason I decided to start a home lab was to:

- Gain more comfortability setting up different types of software.
- Operate a server.
- Learn more about hardware.

The purpose of this documentation is to provide insights into my setup, configurations, and the various technologies I'm exploring within my home lab environment.
